He further stated that he was informed of the order dated June 25, 1970, on July 6, 1970.
He further alleged that the order of the Home Minister approving the detention of the petitioner was never communicated to him within the prescribed period of 24 days.
It was denied that the order of the Government was passed on July 16, 1970, as it purported to do on the face of it.
5.
This petition was heard immediately after Writ Petition No. 310 of 1970 in which we have just delivered judgment.
The only additional point raised by the learned Counsel was that as order No.
PDA DMS 86 70 dated June 25, 1970, which directed that the petitioner be informed that it was against public interest to disclose to him the grounds on which the detention order was not communicated to him till July 6, 1970, the detention order is bad.
The learned Counsel for the State showed the original order to us and it bears the signature of the petitioner and under it the date July 3, 1970, appears.
In view of this we must hold that the affidavit sworn to before us by the petitioner regarding this fact is false and that as a matter of fact he was informed of the said order on July 3, 1970.
6.
We need not go into the question whether he was arrested on June 25 or June 26, 1970 because even if he was arrested on June 25, 1970 without any warrant this would not make the present detention illegal.
7.
In the result the petition fails and is dismissed.
