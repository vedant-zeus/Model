The defendant flied a written statement denying these allegaltions.
Appropriate issues were framed on April 4, 1956.
On June 5, 1956, an application was filed by the plaintiff and the defendant that a compromise had been effected on the following terms: "(a) Decree for ejectment be passed in favour of the plaintiff against the defendant, the decree will be executable after the 31st December, 1958, if the defendant does not give possession till then.
(b) The standard rent of the premises be fixed at Rs. 40 - per mensem, instead of Rs. 50 - paid at present payable from the 1st July, 1956, till the defendant vacates the premises.
(c) The amount, in deposit with this Court be paid to the plaintiff which will be adjusted between the On July 6, 1956, the counsel for the parties and the plaintiff made a statement on solemn affirmation to the same effect, and on the same day the Court recorded the following order: "In view of the statement of the parties' counsel and the written compromise, a decree is passed in favour of the plaintiff against the defendant."
The decree was drawn up accordingly.
The defendant, however, did not vacate the premises' on December 31, 1958.
On the other hand, he presented an application on February 16, 1959, under s. 47, C.P.C., challenging the validity of the decree alleging that the same had been passed in contravention of the provisions of s. 13 of the Delhi and Ajmer Rent Control Act, 1952 (XXXVIII of 1952), (hereinafter referred to as the Act) and hence the decree was a nullity.
He failed before the Sub-Judge, 'and also'on appeal before the Senior Sub-Judge, Delhi.
The High Court, on revision, held that the decree was a nullity as the order passed on the basis of the compromise did not indicate that any of the statutory grounds mentioned in s. 13 of the Act existed.
In Bahadur Singh's case(1)
this Court held that the decree passed on the basis of an award was in contravention of s. 13(1) of the Act became the Court had passed the decree in terms of the award without satisfying itself that the ground of eviction existed.
Bachawat, J,.
speaking for the Court, observed that "on the plain wording of s. 13(1)
the Court was forbidden to pass the decree.
The decree is a nullity and cannot be enforced in execution."
This Court, accordingly, declared inter alia that "the decree in so far as it directs delivery of possession of the premises to the landlord is a nullity and cannot be executed."
The present case is also governed by the provisions of s. 13(1) of the Act and, as we have said before, this appeal must fail, in view of the judgment of this Court in Bahadur Singh's case(x).
In the result the appeal is dismissed but there will be no order as to costs.
R.K.P.S. Appeal dismissed.
