An application was also filed on behalf of the appellants that they had compounded the offence with Ram Sarup injured person.
An affidavit of Ram Sarup was also filed and in that affidavit Ram Sarup stated that he had amicably settled the matter with the appellants of his own free will and without any extraneous pressure.

The offence under Section 324 Indian Penal Code in compoundable with the permission of the court.
