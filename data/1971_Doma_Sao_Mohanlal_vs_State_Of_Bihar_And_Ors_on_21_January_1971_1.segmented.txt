Without deciding that the business in respect of which the liability to pay tax arose was entirely transferred to the appellant, the liability to pay tax assessed against Doma Sao Kishun Lall could not be enforced against the appellant.
Reliance was, sought to be placed by the State upon a decision of the High Court of Patna in Writ Petition M.J.C. No. 11574 of 1960 between M s. Doma Shaw Mohanlal Shaw v. Board of Revenue and Others.
In that case the High Court had observed that the Muradpur business of the firm Doma Shaw Kishun Lall was entirely transferred to the petitioner firm and hence the tax payable in respect of the said business, which remained unpaid at the time of the transfer, was payable by the transferee.
The tax sought to be recovered in the proceedings out of which that writ petition arose related to the assessment year 1949-50.
But each assessment period is a distinct, and any decision by the authorities declaring liability to tax cannot operate as res judicata in respect of another period.

The High Court did not held an investigation in the present case whether the appellant was a transferee to whom the ownership of the entire business of the Hindu Undivided Family which was assessed to tax was entirely transferred.
In the absence of such a finding, the judgment of the High Court cannot be sustained.
9.
The order passed by the High Court must therefore be set aside and the proceeding remanded to the High Court to be dealt with and disposed of according to law, after issuing a notice against the State and after considering the evidence in that behalf.
No order as to costs.
