During the first quarter its tax liability was Rs.
62,061.86 and during the second quarter its tax liability was Rs.

5.
The question for consideration is whether in view of Section 9(3) of the Central Act, the assessee is entitled to the rebate provided in Section 13(8) of the Orissa Act.
Quite clearly the rebate for payment of the tax levied within the time prescribed under the Orissa Act was provided as a stimulus for prompt payment.
The question is whether such a stimulus is a part of the manner of collection.
The rebate is offered to facilitate and expedite collection.
It is intended to stimulate the collection.
Therefore it is a part of the process of collection.
In that view, it is proper to hold that in view of Section 9(3) of the Central Act, the rebate provided in Section 13(8) of the Orissa Act is payable to the assessees under the Central Act, if they pay the tax assessed within the prescribed time.
The power to collect the tax assessed in the same manner as the tax on the sale and purchase of goods under the, general sales tax law of the State provided in Section 9(3) of the Act includes within itself all concessions given under the Orissa Act for payment within the prescribed time.
6.
For the reasons mentioned above, we allow this appeal and set aside the order of the High Court and issue a direction to the respondents to grant to the appellant the rebate provided in Section 13(8) of the Orissa Act.
The respondents shall pay the costs of the appellant both in this Court as well as in the High Court.
