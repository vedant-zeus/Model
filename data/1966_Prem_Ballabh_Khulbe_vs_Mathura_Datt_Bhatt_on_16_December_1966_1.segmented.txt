The decree holder now Indian Kanoon - http: indiankanoon.org doc 1048650  2 Prem Ballabh Khulbe versus Mathura Datt Bhatt on 16 December, 1966 appeals to this court under a certificate granted by the High Court.
On behalf of the appellant our attention was drawn to ss. 9, 15, 18, 46 and 48 of the Indian Partnership Act 1932 and ss. 88, 94 and 95 of the Indian Trusts Act 1882, and it was urged that the respondent as the managing partner of the firm was bound in a fiduciary capacity to account for the assets of the partnership in his hands and the decree against him must be regarded as a decree for a sum for which he was bound in a fiduciary capacity to account.
On the question whether a fiduciary relation exists between, the partners, the law is stated thus in Halsbury's Laws of England 3rd Edition, Vol. 38, Article.
1363, p. 820 : "Partnership itself does not create a fiduciary relation between the partners or make one of them a trustee for the other or for his representatives.
The relation may, however, arise on the death of one of them or be created by other special circumstances."
This statement of law is consistent with the provisions of the Indian Partnership Act 1932 and the Indian Trusts Act 1882.
In Piddocke v. Burt.
(1) Chitty, J. held that a partner failing to pay moneys in his hands and received by him on account of the partnership was not liable to be imprisoned under s. 4(3) of the Debtors Act 1869 as a person "acting in a fiduciary capacity" within the meaning of that statute.
He said : "I should be straining the law if I were to hold that a partner receiving money on account of the partnership-that is, on behalf of himself and his co-partners- (1)  1894  1 ch.
343 received it in a fiduciary capacity towards the other partners.
The law allows one partner-one of several joint creditors-to receive the whole debt on account of the firm to whom it is due, and I am unable to recognise any such distinction, as was endeavoured to be made by Mr. Church, between the case of a partner receiving money of the firm and not accounting for it, and that of a partner over-drawing the partnership account; because if this distinction were true, it would apply to every case where one partner wrongly over draws the partnership account."
This decision was approved of by Lord Atkinson in Rodriguez v. Speyer Brothers,(1) and by Harries, C. J. in Bhuban Mohan Rana v. Surender Mohan Das.(2)
The last case received the approval observe the utmost good faith in his dealings with the other partners.
He is bound to render accounts of the partnership assets in his hands.
But in the absence of special circumstances he cannot be regarded as a kind of trustee for the other partners or liable to render accounts to them in a fiduciary capacity.
In the present case, the respondent as the managing partner was liable to render accounts of the partnership assets in his hands.
.,On
the taking of the accounts it was found that he overdrew the partnership account and a decree for the sum due was passed against him.
No fraud or clandestine dealing is alleged or proved.
On these facts it is not possible to say that the decree was for a sum for Indian Kanoon - http: indiankanoon.org doc 1048650  3 Prem Ballabh Khulbe versus Mathura Datt Bhatt on 16 December, 1966 which he was bound to account in a fiduciary capacity.
The High Court rightly held that the conditions of Clause.
(c) of the  proviso to s. 51 of the Code of Civil Procedure were not satisfied.
The appeal is dismissed.
There will be no order as to costs.
Y.P. Appeal dismissed.
